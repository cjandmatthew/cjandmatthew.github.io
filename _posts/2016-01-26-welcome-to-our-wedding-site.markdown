Hi There! If you're here, you're probably looking to find a bit of info about our wedding. You'll notice that this site is currently still in development, but we've added Travel and Wedding Info for the many (almost all) of you that will be traveling to KC with us.

See these stairs? Walk up those stairs and through that door to celebrate with us at Boulevard Brewery!

Matthew is using our wedding as an opportunity to teach me some simple markup and HTML. He's building some fancy new features like RSVPs and Maps, and I've gotta work on more details and registry info. Check back soon for updates.
