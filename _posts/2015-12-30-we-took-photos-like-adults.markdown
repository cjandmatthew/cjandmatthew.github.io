Our lovely photographer [Angie Harris](http://www.angieharrisphotography.com) captured some great moments with us over the holidays. This is our favorite. Come celebrate with us. Boulevard beers on tap at our Brewery reception.

No joke. Matthew traded me beers so I could have the IPA. How did I get into the hoppy beers? I blame you, Robert Bliss.

We played in the snow a bit so we could get some neat shots of Union Station and the KC skyline. Kansas City has gotten really cool! People will want to come here if we make it look appealing!

This was the moment we realized that people are going to know it is absolutely freezing in Kansas City, and no one will want to go there.

There are secret passages inside Union Station! You should check them out when you're here!
