## Flight Recommendations

If you are flying into Kansas City, the nearest airport is Kansas City International, code: **MCI**. The airport is approximately 20 minutes north of downtown Kansas City.

[Several Airlines fly into MCI.](http://www.flykci.com/flight-information/airlines-at-kci/) We most often fly Southwest from BUR to MCI, and they have several non-stop flights to MCI out of LAX, OAK, Chicago, etc.
