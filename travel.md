## Flight Recommendations

If you are flying into Kansas City, the nearest airport is Kansas City International, code: **MCI**. The airport is approximately 20 minutes north of downtown Kansas City.

[Several Airlines fly into MCI.](http://www.flykci.com/flight-information/airlines-at-kci/) We most often fly Southwest from BUR to MCI, and they have several non-stop flights to MCI out of LAX, OAK, Chicago, etc.

## Hotel Recommendations

We are in the process of securing a room block and wedding rate at a hotel in downtown Kansas City near the reception location. We will provide that info ASAP.

## Ground Transportation

We will provide trolleys to shuttle the wedding party and guests from the Hotel to and from the Ceremony and Reception. Airport shuttles, taxis, and Uber are all options in Kansas City if you don't choose to rent a car.

## Things to Do

Here are a few ideas if you plan to spend a few extra days in Kansas City. Some of these can be walked to from the Hotel/Reception site, and some would require an Uber or a car.
